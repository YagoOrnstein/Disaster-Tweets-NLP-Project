# Disaster-Tweets-NLP-Project
Disaster Tweets NLP Project is a self project for improving my knowladge about NLP tasks.
Experiments I Did:
1- Naive Bayer with TF-IDF encoder
2- Feed-Forward Neural Network (Dense Model)
3- LSTM (RNN)
4- GRU (RNN)
5- Bidirectional-LSTM (RNN)
8- 1D Convolutional Neural Network
9- Pretrained Feature Extractor
10-Pretrained Feature Extractor (10% of data)
and comparison with each other to see the results.
